Project 2
In this project we studied both classification and regression problems. 
Looking at methods from linear and logistic regression to neural networks. 
We used logistic regression and neural networks to solve a classification
problem derived from credit card data from Taiwan. 
Then we looked at a linear regression problem using OLS, Ridge and Lasso 
to find a fit for Franke function (from project 1) and used these 
results to compare with how our neural network performed on this regression problem. 

Getting started
In this folder, Project 2, youÂ’ll find the report for this problem in the root folder, 
source code and the dataset are in the folder scr. 
There will be descriptions of classes and functions in the relevant notebooks. 

The file LogisticRegression.ipynb deals with parts a and b of the problem set.
To run it, make sure to get the correct figure from the plt folder, and refer to it correctly in the code.

The file NN_self.ipynb deals with the rest of the problem set.
To run it, make sure to get the correct figure from the plt folder, and refer to it correctly in the code.
