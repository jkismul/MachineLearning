Project 3
In this project we studied the performance of (C)NNs, XGBoost and SVM on classification problems (MNIST, and Taiwan Credit Card Data) and on Regression (on noisy data generated by Frankes function).

The report can be found in the root directory, while the code (with data and figures needed to run) are found in the code folder. Where relevant, description of functions and code is supplied within the notebooks.

The file CNN.ipynb deals with CNN on the MNIST data set. NNs on the other data sets were performed in Project 2.

The file SVM.ipynb uses SVM on the MNIST data set, The Taiwan Credit Card data set and the Franke function. Make sure to get the Gains_logreg.jpg file for plots, and the "default of credit card clients.xls" files in the same folder to run.

The file Forests.ipynb performs some analysis of Random Forests, and then Boosting on all the three data sets, as well as a toy example. This file also contains the brunt of the PCA analysis of the MNIST data set.
